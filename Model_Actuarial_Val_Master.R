# Goals: 
# 1. Conduct actuarial valuations each year during a time period of 100 years, allowing for stochastic investment returns.
# 2. Conduct the stochastic simulation in 3 for 10k times. 

# Assumptions
 # Plan Desgin
  # Beneficiary:  : Retirement Only; No disability, death, surivorship benefits
  # Benfit formula: % of FAS per YOS; FAS for last # years
  # Retirment age : NO early retirement
  # Vesting:      : Vested if YOS > #

 # Cost Method
  # 1) EAN(Entry Age Normal)
  # 2) PUC(Projected Unit Credit)

 # Actuarial Assumptions
  # Decrements: Mortality, termination, disability
  # Salary scale
  # Assumed interest rate
  # Inflation
  # Productivity
 
 # Contribution rules: 
    # 1. Sponsor contributes full ADC, which equals the amount of plan cost(Normal cost + supplemental cost) in all periods.
    # 2. Sponsor contributes ADC with a cap, which equals a percentage of total payroll.    
    # 3. Sponsor contributes a fixed percentage of payroll. 

# Outputs
  # Actuarial liability
  # Normal costs
  # Assets
  # UAAL
  # Funded Ratio

# List of tasks:
# Allow age up to 120
# Choosing amortization method
# Module for reading in model inputs
# Further modulize the model. 
# More options of initial asset value? eg. % of AL

# 0. Parameters ####
#*********************************************************************************************************
# Restrictions on current version
# 1. r.max must be in the range [55, 65]
# 2. v.yos <= r.max - r.min
# Note: The restrictions above are removed in current version since we use single retirement age and set r.min = r.max.

## Model parameters
nyear <- 100        # # of years in simulation 
ncore <- 4          # # of CPU cores used in parallelled loops

## Benefit structure
benfactor <- 0.015  # benefit factor, % of final average salary per year of yos
fasyears  <- 3      # number of years in the final average salary calculation
# WARNING: In curret version, please do not set a r.max greater than 65 and less than 55 
r.max     <- 65     # maximum retirement age, at which all actives retire with probability 1. 
r.min     <- r.max  # minimum retirement age. (for multi-retirement ages, will not be used in current version)
                    # Current version depends on the assumption that active workers do not quit their jobs once reaching age r.min. 
cola      <- 0.01   # annual growth of retirement benefits in a simple COLA 

v.yos     <- 10      # yos required to be vested.  
r.yos     <- 10      # yos required to be eligible for early retirement

## Actuarial assumptions

# Economic assumptions
infl <- 0.03        # Assumed inflation
prod <- 0.01        # Assumed productivity
i <- 0.08           # Assumed discount rate
v <- 1/(1 + i)      # discount factor

# Actuarial method
actuarial_method <- "EAN.CP"  # One of "PUC", "EAN.CD", "EAN.CP"

# Amortization 
amort_type   <- "closed"  # one of "closed" and "open".
 # Notes:
 #  "closed": Loss/gain + underfunding of ADC for each year is amortized separately using closed-ended method.
 #  "open"  : UAAL of each year is amortized using open-ended method.
amort_method <- "cd" # "cd" for Constant dollar, "cp" for constant percent, "sl" for straitline
m = 3                # years of amortization of gain/loss


## Contriubtion Policy
ConPolicy    <- "ADC"
PR_pct_cap   <- 0.25
PR_pct_fixed <- 0.145
 # Values of ConPolicy:
  # ADC:     pay full ADC
  # ADC_cap: pay full ADC with a cap, which is defined as a proportion of payroll. If ADC_cap is chosen, set the parameter PR_pct_cap.
  # Fixed:   pay a fixed percent of payroll. If Fixed is chosen, set the parameter PR_pct_fixed.
EEC_rate     <- 0.005   

# For now the employer and employee contributions are calculated as follows:
# 1). Calculate ADC = NC + SC
# 2). Calculate EEC = EEC_rate * Payroll
# 3). Calculate employer's proportion of ADC: ADC_ER = ADC - EEC
# 4). Employer's contribution ERC is determined by one of the three contribution rules
# 5). Total contribution: C = EEC + ERC
# Potential problem:
  # Employee contribution as % of salary. For now this rate is fixed in all period, even 
  # employee contribution is greater than normal costs and results in negative employer contribution.
  # More rules are needed to avoid negative contributions.

# Note: The difference between expected and actual investment return will be realized over s.year years. (realize 1/s.year each year) 
s.year <- 10    # amortization period for unexpected investment gain/loss
s.vector <- seq(0,1,length = s.year + 1)[-(s.year+1)]; s.vector  # a vector containing the porportion of 

# Parameters for asset smoothing method 2 (TPAF)
# Note: actuarial asset value of current year is a weighted average of expected actuarial asset value and market asset value. 
init_MA  <- "AL"  # "MA" for preset value; "AL" for being equal to initial liability 
EAA_0    <- MA_0  # expected market value at 0

 range_ea <- 20:(r.max - 1)                          # Complete range of entry ages. Most time comsuming. 

range_age <- 20:110 # please do not change this for now. The code needs to be modified if we use life table with larger max age.  

# Initial Active
# WARNING: Ages and entry ages of active members must be less than retirement age. (max retirement age when multiple retirement ages is implemented)

# 1. Import Salary table and initial retirement benefit table ####
#*********************************************************************************************************

# Notes:
# 1. User must provide the following data frames
#   "salary": a complete salary table containing salary history of current actives and projected salary path for future workers,
#              both of which are calculated based on a salary table of current actives from the AV and assumptions on salary growth.  
#   "avgben": a data frame containing average retirement benefit payment(including both service retirement and deferred retirement)
#             of all valid ea and age combos. The user MUST make sure the smallest age in the retirement benefit table is smaller than the 
#             single retirement age specified in parameter section. (smaller than r.min with multiple retirement ages)
# 2. Note that avgben is only used to calculate the current and projected values of benefits and liabilities of retirees at year 1. Future retirees' 
#    benefits and liabilities are calculated based on their salary history provided in "salary". 
# 3. I don't think in "avgben" we need average benefit for all combos of ea and age. All we need is actually average benefits
#    by age. Once we have that we can assign an arbitrary ea to it an throw it into the model. Note that the AV of NJ-TPAF only contains 
#    average benefits for retirees and vested terms by age group. Also note that if service retirees and vested terms follow the same mortality table 
#    and have the same COLA rule, I don't think we need to distinguish between them.     
#

# Artificial salary table and benefit table for testing purpose are imported by sourcing the following script.
# These tables are based on PA-PSERS and some naive assumptions for imputation.
# Please do NOT source the script below if external salary and benefit tables are used.
